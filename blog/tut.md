# How to calculate your HRI?

Take all the NFTs in the collection, find their average rarity rank, then divide by twice the number of NFTs.

Do this for both Combeys & Combots for now, then average those 2 numbers, and that's your HRI! This is the number you see on the landing page. 

We'll announce when Combiens math is added!
